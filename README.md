## HubSpot Data Extraction within 50 miles of Atlanta, Georgia

This project is not cleaned up to have everything done in a click of a button. This just will show my abilities with Python and pandas for employers.

- MAIN GOAL: Filter contacts to only records within a 50 mile radius of a center-point based in Atlanta, Georgia
- Extracted a full .csv file of "Contacts" information from HubSpot UI
- Consolidated data across multiple properties (columns) into a source-of-truth
- Further filtered contact records into 4 other sheets: job titles with executive positions, job titles with HR positions, general job titles, and records without any city or zip code.
- Tech stack: Python (pandas, geopy), Excel, Google Sheets, Haversine formula
